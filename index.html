        <p>Welcome to my GitHub Pages. In here, you may find my projects and explorations on various numerical methods, algorithms and other subjects that may interest me. The site is still evolving as I slowly add my various projects.</p>

            <h2>Simulation Methods</h2>
            <h3><u>Monte Carlo Integration</u></h3>
            <p>In this short project, I investigate the Monte Carlo integration, a statistical method used for approximating the numerical value of definite integrals. 
                The research, conducted using Jupyter Notebooks, focuses on examining how variations in the number of simulations and the choice of the upper bound affect the accuracy of the computed
                integral value. It was observed that beyond approximately 200,000 simulations, the incremental improvement in accuracy begins to taper off.
            The observations from this research provide insights that could guide the design and implementation of Monte Carlo integration in real-world scenarios,
                helping to optimize computational resources while maintaining desired accuracy levels.</p>

            <h3><u>Numerical Approximation of Differential Equations</u></h3>
            <p>This study focuses on the numerical approximation of a model differential equation subjected to given boundary conditions using a finite difference method. A model problem - 
             a second-order ordinary differential equation with variable coefficients - is discretized by replacing each derivative term with finite differences,
                transforming the problem into a set of linear equations. These equations are represented in a matrix format and are solved using matrix inversion. The approximated results are then compared
                with an exact solution for a specific differential equation to investigate the accuracy of the numerical method. 
                The analysis shows that the accuracy of the approximation improves significantly as the number of interior mesh points (n) increases, 
                confirming the convergence of the numerical method to the exact solution. This method provides an effective and accurate way to solve differential equations when the analytical solution is not readily available. </p>

            <p>The list of projects above is evolving. Check back here later for more work. All the projects have been done on a completely voluntary basis in my spare time, and should not be considered formal academic papers.</p>
