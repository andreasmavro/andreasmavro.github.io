# Welcome to AndreasMavro.github.io!

This is the repository for my personal GitHub Pages website, where I share my various projects and explorations in algorithms and simulations

## What You'll Find Here

This website will serve as a platform for me to share my work and knowledge on a range of topics. This work is done on my own time for fun. The code is not optimized and accuracy is not guaranteed.

Here are some of the things you can expect to find:

- Detailed walkthroughs of various algorithm and simulation methods.
- Code examples, primarily in Python, demonstrating these methods in practice.
- Visualizations and discussions of project results.

## How I'm Building This

The content for this site is created in a variety of formats. For many of the projects, I'm using Jupyter Notebooks to write the code and create visualizations. These notebooks are then converted into Markdown for display on the website.

## Questions or Comments

If you have any questions or comments about the projects or methods presented here, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always open to feedback and discussions about the work I'm doing.

Thank you for visiting!
